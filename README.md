# External GeoGuessr Location Cheat
This script hooks into the google maps API requests used by Geoguessr to display streetview panorama's, extracts the coordinates of the location from the response and then streams them to my external server.

I then make these coordinates available to you, via my website `https://georesolver.0x978.com/`, where you can enter the key provided to you on the installation of the script to see the coordinates update in real-time, displayed as both a google maps embed and city/country info.

A little installation guide / demo can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnCaQe9KHUg

## Yap:

This script is free to use, with no Anti Features (e.g. no ads, no donation links etc) all I ask is for feedback, ratings and criticisms :)

If you are looking to modify the script, please make pull requests! I would love to see other people's ideas.

Updates are **not** guaranteed if the script breaks, since this is something I am doing in my free time.

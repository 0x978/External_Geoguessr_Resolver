## Yap:

This script is free to use, with no Anti Features (e.g. no ads, no donation links etc) all I ask is for feedback, ratings and criticisms :)

If you are looking to modify the script, please make pull requests! I would love to see other people's ideas.

Updates are **not** guaranteed if the script breaks, since this is something I am doing in my free time.
